          Hello! I'm a passionate blogger and developer. I love sharing my thoughts and experiences through this blog.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My background is in web development, with a focus on modern technologies like React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
          When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me exploring nature or reading a good book.
